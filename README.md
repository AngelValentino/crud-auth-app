# CRUD Auth App

This basic CRUD authentication website is a **monolithic, MVC-based application** designed for efficient task management. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern in a procedural manner, where the **Model** handles data and business logic, the **View** displays the user interface, and the **Controller** processes user input, updating the Model and View accordingly. As a **monolithic** system, the entire application is integrated into a single codebase, making it easier to deploy and manage, though scalability can be a concern as the app grows.

The app features a **robust authentication system** that ensures secure user login and access to personalized data. It offers comprehensive **CRUD functionality** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tasks, while a reliable **security system** protects sensitive information and prevents unauthorized access. This combination of features makes this simple application a secure and efficient solution for managing tasks in a streamlined, user-friendly manner.
